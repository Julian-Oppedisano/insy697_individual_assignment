You are a forecasting expert. Your task is to predict the average Google review star rating for the Montreal Marriott Ch√¢teau Champlain hotel for the period of June 2, 2025, to June 6, 2025.

Current baseline information:
- The current overall mean Google review star rating for this hotel is 4.12 (based on 200 reviews).
- Recent daily review trends (new review counts and mean ratings for the last 30 days of activity) are available in 'hotel_daily_metrics.csv'.

Consider the baseline and recent trends. Now, also evaluate the potential impact of the following hypothetical scenarios on the hotel's average rating for the forecast period. Provide step-by-step reasoning for how each scenario, if it were to occur in the months leading up to June 2025, might influence the rating:

Scenario A: The hotel hosts a major international conference in May 2025, leading to a sudden influx of ~100 new reviews. These conference-goers are typically more critical.
Scenario B: A popular travel vlogger with a large following posts a highly positive video review of the hotel in April 2025, potentially attracting a wave of new, enthusiastic guests.
Scenario C: The city of Montreal announces a major festival near the hotel for the first week of June 2025, leading to full occupancy and potentially strained hotel resources.

After your step-by-step reasoning for each scenario's potential impact (or lack thereof if you believe a scenario is neutral), provide an overall "most likely" forecast for the period June 2-6, 2025, assuming none of these specific extreme scenarios definitively occur, but considering general uncertainties.

Output your final "most likely" forecast as a single number between 1.0 and 5.0, rounded to one decimal place, on a new line after your reasoning, prefixed with "Final Forecast:". For example:

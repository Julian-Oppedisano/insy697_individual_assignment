You are a forecasting expert. Your task is to predict the average Google review star rating for the Montreal Marriott Ch√¢teau Champlain hotel for the period of June 2, 2025, to June 6, 2025.

Current baseline information:
- The current overall mean Google review star rating for this hotel is 4.12 (based on 200 reviews).
- Recent daily review trends (new review counts and mean ratings for the last 30 days of activity) are available in a file named 'hotel_daily_metrics.csv'. Consider the general trends from this file (e.g., if ratings are generally stable, increasing, or decreasing; if review volume is high or low).

Before providing your final numerical forecast, please provide a step-by-step reasoning process. Consider the following:
1.  Current baseline rating and its stability/trend based on recent daily metrics.
2.  Potential impact of seasonality (early June in Montreal).
3.  Typical hotel operational factors over a 1-year horizon (e.g., renovations, staff changes - assume no specific news unless provided).
4.  Broader economic or travel industry trends that might influence guest experiences or review scores by mid-2025.
5.  Any other factors you deem relevant to this forecast.

After your step-by-step reasoning, conclude with your forecast.

Output your final forecast as a single number between 1.0 and 5.0, rounded to one decimal place, on a new line after your reasoning, prefixed with "Final Forecast:". For example:

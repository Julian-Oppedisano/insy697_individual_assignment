Hotel forecast revised based on critique (Task T52).
Original ensemble of 6 forecasts had a mean of 4.02 and std dev of 0.49.
The critique highlighted one forecast of 3.0 as a potential outlier. This forecast was from provider 'openai', model 'gpt-4o' at temperature 0.7.
This outlier was removed. The remaining 5 forecasts are: [4.0, 4.4, 4.0, 4.5, 4.2].
The revised mean predicted rating is 4.22 with a revised standard deviation of 0.2.
This revision leads to a mean closer to the baseline and a tighter standard deviation, addressing a key concern from the critique.

You are a forecasting expert. Your task is to predict the average Google review star rating for the Montreal Marriott Ch√¢teau Champlain hotel for the period of June 2, 2025, to June 6, 2025.

Current baseline information:
- The current overall mean Google review star rating for this hotel is 4.12 (based on 200 reviews).
- Recent daily review trends (new review counts and mean ratings for the last 30 days of activity) are available in a file named 'hotel_daily_metrics.csv'. Assume you have access to the general trends from this file (e.g., if ratings are generally stable, increasing, or decreasing; if review volume is high or low).

Based on this information, and considering typical factors that might influence hotel ratings over a ~1-year forecast horizon (e.g., seasonality, hotel maintenance cycles, general economic conditions for travel), provide your forecast.

Output your forecast as a single number between 1.0 and 5.0, rounded to one decimal place. For example: 4.3

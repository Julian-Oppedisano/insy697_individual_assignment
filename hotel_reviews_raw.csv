Divya Chattlani,1.0,"We booked a two-night stay at the Marriott Château Champlain in downtown Montreal but ended up leaving a day early due to several disappointing aspects that did not meet our expectations.

We reserved a room for two adults and one child, specifically requesting a crib. Upon arrival, we were given a very small room with two beds and no crib in sight. To be honest, I’m not sure a crib would have even fit in the space. The room felt cramped and the bathroom was extremely basic, definitely not what we anticipated from a supposedly highly rated Marriott property.

We also had access to the club lounge, which offers breakfast and evening hors d’oeuvres for higher-tier Bonvoy members. Unfortunately, the lounge lacked any visible staff and felt poorly maintained. At one point, every table was cluttered with dirty dishes and there was no available seating. The food was underwhelming at best. It’s very dark and lacks enthusiasm.

Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to families. It may be suitable for a short business stay, but the rooms are stuffy, the atmosphere feels cold, and the staff were generally unwelcoming. We were relieved to check out early and spend our second night at another Bonvoy property, where we had a much better experience.

A final note of feedback for the front desk: when we requested an early checkout, the agent barely acknowledged us - no eye contact, no courtesy, just a few keystrokes and a dismissive “it’s done” before walking away.

Divya Chattlani,1.0,"We booked a two-night stay at the Marriott Château Champlain in downtown Montreal but ended up leaving a day early due to several disappointing aspects that did not meet our expectations.

We reserved a room for two adults and one child, specifically requesting a crib. Upon arrival, we were given a very small room with two beds and no crib in sight. To be honest, I’m not sure a crib would have even fit in the space. The room felt cramped and the bathroom was extremely basic, definitely not what we anticipated from a supposedly highly rated Marriott property.

We also had access to the club lounge, which offers breakfast and evening hors d’oeuvres for higher-tier Bonvoy members. Unfortunately, the lounge lacked any visible staff and felt poorly maintained. At one point, every table was cluttered with dirty dishes and there was no available seating. The food was underwhelming at best. It’s very dark and lacks enthusiasm.

Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to families. It may be suitable for a short business stay, but the rooms are stuffy, the atmosphere feels cold, and the staff were generally unwelcoming. We were relieved to check out early and spend our second night at another Bonvoy property, where we had a much better experience.

A final note of feedback for the front desk: when we requested an early checkout, the agent barely acknowledged us - no eye contact, no courtesy, just a few keystrokes and a dismissive “it’s done” before walking away.

Divya Chattlani,1.0,"We booked a two-night stay at the Marriott Château Champlain in downtown Montreal but ended up leaving a day early due to several disappointing aspects that did not meet our expectations.

We reserved a room for two adults and one child, specifically requesting a crib. Upon arrival, we were given a very small room with two beds and no crib in sight. To be honest, I’m not sure a crib would have even fit in the space. The room felt cramped and the bathroom was extremely basic, definitely not what we anticipated from a supposedly highly rated Marriott property.

We also had access to the club lounge, which offers breakfast and evening hors d’oeuvres for higher-tier Bonvoy members. Unfortunately, the lounge lacked any visible staff and felt poorly maintained. At one point, every table was cluttered with dirty dishes and there was no available seating. The food was underwhelming at best. It’s very dark and lacks enthusiasm.

Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to families. It may be suitable for a short business stay, but the rooms are stuffy, the atmosphere feels cold, and the staff were generally unwelcoming. We were relieved to check out early and spend our second night at another Bonvoy property, where we had a much better experience.

A final note of feedback for the front desk: when we requested an early checkout, the agent barely acknowledged us - no eye contact, no courtesy, just a few keystrokes and a dismissive “it’s done” before walking away. In hospitality, professionalism and warmth make a difference, and unfortunately, we didn’t experience either here.",3 weeks ago,2025-05-03T16:22:28Z,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101044456852200603880?hl=en-US,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNZMnNlR0VBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xe6d5b1d51a39f768!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMCY2seGEA%7CCgsIkezewAYQsO-iLA%7C?hl=en-US,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNZMnNlR0VBEAE,ChIJAwCz2VwayUwRaPc5GtWx1eY

Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to families. It may be suitable for a short business stay, but the rooms are stuffy, the atmosphere feels cold, and the staff were generally unwelcoming. We were relieved to check out early and spend our second night at another Bonvoy property, where we had a much better experience.

A final note of feedback for the front desk: when we requested an early checkout, the agent barely acknowledged us - no eye contact, no courtesy, just a few keystrokes and a dismissive “it’s done” before walking away. In hospitality, professionalism and warmth make a difference, and unfortunately, we didn’t experience either here.",3 weeks ago,2025-05-03T16:22:28Z,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101044456852200603880?hl=en-US,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNZMnNlR0VBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xe6d5b1d51a39f768!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgMCY2seGEA%7CCgsIkezewAYQsO-iLA%7C?hl=en-US,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNZMnNlR0VBEAE,ChIJAwCz2VwayUwRaPc5GtWx1eY

cristienhuang,5.0,"We booked three rooms for four nights at the Marriott Montreal and had a wonderful stay. The rooms were spacious with breathtaking views, offering a comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. The lounge was a highlight—nicely designed with a good variety of snacks throughout the day, although note that alcohol is not complimentary. Breakfast in the lounge was excellent, and the staff were especially warm and welcoming, particularly with our kids. The location is also a major plus, with easy access to the metro, making it convenient to explore the city. Highly recommended for families and anyone looking for a comfortable stay in Montreal.",3 weeks ago,2025-05-07T23:59:59Z,,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g155032-d185746-r1006287777?m=68573&staydates=2025_06_08_2025_06_09&uguests=1_2_0&supdv=unknown&supuc=US&supul=en,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g155032-d185746-r1006287777?m=68573&staydates=2025_06_08_2025_06_09&uguests=1_2_0&supdv=unknown&supuc=US&supul=en,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VPXzRuNXpFNXViQVFnEAE,ChIJAwCz2VwayUwRaPc5GtWx1eY
Divya Chattlani,1.0,"We booked a two-night stay at the Marriott Château Champlain in downtown Montreal but ended up leaving a day early due to several disappointing aspects that did not meet our expectations.

We reserved a room for two adults and one child, specifically requesting a crib. Upon arrival, we were given a very small room with two beds and no crib in sight. To be honest, I’m not sure a crib would have even fit in the space. The room felt cramped and the bathroom was extremely basic, definitely not what we anticipated from a supposedly highly rated Marriott property.

We also had access to the club lounge, which offers breakfast and evening hors d’oeuvres for higher-tier Bonvoy members. Unfortunately, the lounge lacked any visible staff and felt poorly maintained. At one point, every table was cluttered with dirty dishes and there was no available seating. The food was underwhelming at best. It’s very dark and lacks enthusiasm.

Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to families. It may be suitable for a short business stay, but the rooms are stuffy, the atmosphere feels cold, and the staff were generally unwelcoming. We were relieved to check out early and spend our second night at another Bonvoy property, where we had a much better experience.

A final note of feedback for the front desk: when we requested an early checkout, the agent barely acknowledged us - no eye contact, no courtesy, just a few keystrokes and a dismissive “it’s done” before walking away.
